# Color Scheme Generator

With the color scheme generator, you can create your own color palette! It's a JavaScript web app that uses The Color API. You can start by selecting a color and a color scheme and then the app generates a palette for you. You can easily copy the hex code by clicking on the color element. And if you're feeling lucky, you can try the random color button to see what color palette it generates for you.
